<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>RP-8 is a Pico-8 demake of Propellerhead Software’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-33://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-338">ReBirth
RB-338</a>, one of the first commercially successful software
synthesizers. Like the original, it provides two synth voices, drums,
pattern-based sequencing, effects to enrich the sound, a pattern mode
for immediate hands-on control, and a song mode for recording music.</p>
<p>Unlike the original, the audio output is 8 bit 5.5kHz mono sound, and
the user interface is rendered in glorious 128x128 16 color
graphics.</p>

<p>Thank you for trying RP-8, and please don’t hesitate to let me know
what might make RP-8 more pleasant or interesting to use.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">You can contact me at <a
href="mailto:luchak@gmail.com">luchak@gmail.com</a> or via the <a

Lexaloffle BBS.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2 id="using-this-guide">Using This Guide</h2>
<p>This guide will introduce you to the instrument, its major features
and underlying concepts, and how to go about designing sounds and
composing songs. If <strong>you have never used ReBirth</strong>, you
should consider continuing to read through the <a
href="#overview">Overview</a> and <a href="#usage">Usage</a> sections,
which introduce all the major concepts necessary for using RP-8, and
form a mini-tutorial where each part builds on the last. If <strong>you
have used ReBirth</strong>, most of the functionality should be familiar
and you should probably dive right in – however, there are some
differences, so you might want to refer back to this guide if you
encounter anything unexpected.</p>
<p>The <a href="#reference">Reference</a> section describes the
functioning and operation of each part of RP-8 in more detail, and
should be useful at any stage of your RP-8 journey.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<h2 id="running-rp-8">Running RP-8</h2>
<p>RP-8 is a <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a>
cartridge, or cart. You can run it on your own copy of Pico-8 or on the
web-based <a href="https://www.pico-8-edu.com">Pico-8 Educational
Edition</a> by loading the cart PNG file from the <a
href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=47284">RP-8 thread</a> on the
Lexaloffle BBS, or by typing <code>load #rp8</code> at the Pico-8
prompt. (This latter approach will always get you the latest version.)
You can also run RP-8 directly from the Lexaloffle BBS thread. If you
are running RP-8 in a browser, please keep your volume low to start, and
see the <a href="#web-compatibility">Web Compatibility</a> section for
further details.</p>
<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
<p>RP-8 is controlled primarily using the mouse. Each control on the
screen responds either to clicks or drags. Typically, button and toggle
controls respond to clicks, and dial or note controls respond to
vertical dragging. Drag controls also respond to the up and down arrows
and to the mousewheel for fine adjustments.</p>
<p>You can access the menu by pressing <strong>enter</strong>, and
toggle tooltips by pressing <strong>h</strong>. There are more <a
href="#keyboard-controls">Keyboard Controls</a> too, but you don’t need
them to get started.</p>
<h2 id="devices-and-patterns">Devices And Patterns</h2>
<p>Sound in RP-8 is generated by its 3 devices: two identical monophonic
synthesizers loosely inspired by the <a href="">Roland TB-303</a> and
one drum machine that is even more loosely inspired by the <a
href="">Roland TR-808</a> These devices are explained in more detail in
their own sections.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A synth</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="img/drums.png" alt="The drum machine" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The drum machine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In general, you should use the synthesizers for tonal elements in
your songs, like melody or bass lines, and you should use the drum
machine for rhythmic elements. However, all the drums have a tuning
adjustment knob, and many of the sounds can have a strong tonal
character, so stay open-minded!<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">TR-808 bass drums with long decay times are often used
as bass sounds. The sample track of the drum machine can also easily be
used as a third tonal voice.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Each device is controlled by a pattern sequencer, which
plays back sequences of notes or drum hits from a user-programmable bank
of patterns. Patterns are 16 step (1 bar) series of notes or drum hits,
and are the building blocks of music in RP-8.</p>
<p>RP-8 also has a header section at the top of the display, which
houses controls that affect the whole song or pattern: the song/pattern
mode switch, song transport controls, effects controls, and the
mixer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/header_section.png" alt="The header section" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The header section</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="modes">Modes</h2>
<p>RP-8 has two modes: <strong>pattern mode</strong> and <strong>song
mode</strong>. All the same devices and sound creation machinery are
available in both, however, they have different purposes. Pattern mode
gives you immediate direct control of every parameter, so it is ideal
for learning, experimentation, and coming up with new ideas. Song mode
records enables several features for recording, editing, and replay of
parameter changes, and so is best for when you want to start recording
multi-bar sequences and complex automation.</p>
<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>This section provides a description of RP-8’s basic usage mechanics,
and is structured as a guided introduction to RP-8 for first-time
users.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-mode">Pattern Mode</h2>
<h3 id="making-a-drum-pattern">Making A Drum Pattern</h3>
<p>Okay! You’ve got RP-8 loaded and you’re ready to make some music.
Let’s start by creating a simple drum pattern. Notice that at the bottom
of the drum machine there are a row of <em>step buttons</em> that look
like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/drum_step_btns.png" alt="Drum step buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Drum step buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each button represents a 16th note time step. As you click the step
buttons, they will rotate through a few different states: gray, dull
red, and bright red, representing whether a drum hit is played on that
step, and the strength of the hit. Click a few buttons, and then tap the
spacebar (or click the play/pause button) to hear the results - you
should hopefully be hearing some bass drum hits and seeing green lights
sweep from left to right across the step buttons.</p>
<p>While the bass drum is important, you’ll probably want some other
drums too. The drum machine offers six different drums you can sequence,
and you can switch between drums using the drum selector buttons, which
look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/bd_sd_radio_btns.png" style="width:6.25%"
alt="Bass drum (selected) and snare drum (unselected) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bass drum (selected) and snare drum
(unselected) buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you click the snare drum selector, labeled <strong>SD</strong>,
you’ll see that the step buttons have all reset to gray. If you click a
few of these, you should now hear a snare playing along with your bass
drum. To edit the bass drum again, you can click <strong>BD</strong> to
go back. Try sequencing some of the other drums as well!<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><a href="#the-drum-machine">The Drum Machine</a>
explains in more detail what each drum is and how it works.<br />
<br />
</span></span> (Note that the <strong>SP</strong> drum is special and
won’t make any sound just yet - see the <a
href="#loading-samples">Loading Samples</a> section for more information
on how to enable it.)</p>
<h3 id="making-a-synth-pattern">Making A Synth Pattern</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve got a drum beat, let’s try making a synth pattern to
go along with it - this could serve as a melody or a bass line. You’ll
notice that the synths have step buttons, like the drum machine, along
with a row of note controls:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/synth_step_note_btns.png"
alt="Synth step buttons and note controls" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Synth step buttons and note
controls</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like the drum machine, you can click the step buttons to cycle
through different ways to play each note. The new, yellow-colored states
are for note slides - <a href="#the-synths">The Synths</a> explains the
step types in more detail. However, by default, each step will just play
a G. You can use the note controls to change the note - drag up (or use
the up arrow) to make the note higher, or down to make the note lower.
The note controls span several octaves, which are indicated by dots
below the note - more dots correspond to higher octaves. Try using these
controls to program a simple melody or bassline.</p>
<h3 id="switching-patterns">Switching Patterns</h3>
<p>While it’s possible to make a song by repeating a single bar, it’s
also a bit of a challenge. Fortunately, RP-8 supports multiple patterns
to allow for variations and longer phrases. You can switch between
patterns using the pattern and bank selector buttons:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ptn_bank_btns.png" style="width:25.0%"
alt="Bank selector and pattern buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bank selector and pattern
buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are 8 banks (labeled A through H), with 6 patterns per bank
(labeled 1 through 6). The bank selector is a drag control, and the
pattern buttons are click controls. Pattern changes take effect
immediately while RP-8 is paused, but if RP-8 is playing, pattern
changes only take effect at the end of each bar. The current pattern
displays in pink, and the next pattern, if different from the current
one, displays in red. If no patterns are lit up on a device (all display
in dull red) then the active pattern is in a different bank; to find the
active one, flip through banks until one lights up.</p>
<p>Each device has its own pattern storage, so each synth has separate
pattern storage, along with the drum machine. Note that each drum
pattern contains all 6 drum <em>tracks</em>, and you cannot switch
patterns independently for each drum track.</p>
<h3 id="copying-patterns-and-making-variations">Copying Patterns and
Making Variations</h3>
<p>It’s often helpful to have multiple patterns based on the same idea:
alternate rhythms, melodic variations, or drum patterns that add or omit
hits. To help with this, you can copy and paste patterns between slots
on the same device, or between the two synth devices.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">You cannot copy between the synths and the drum
machine, or between different drum tracks. All drum tracks in a drum
pattern are copied together.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The pattern copy and paste buttons are located on the
devices just above the pattern buttons, and look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ptn_copy_paste_btns.png" style="width:12.5%"
alt="Pattern copy (left) and paste (right) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pattern copy (left) and paste (right)
buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Click the copy button to copy the current pattern, and click the
paste button to replace the current pattern with the last copied
pattern. If you have a pattern change pending for the next bar, these
buttons operate on the currently playing pattern, <em>not</em> on the
pending pattern.</p>
<h3 id="tweaking-sounds">Tweaking Sounds</h3>
<p>RP-8 is designed for making music where sound design and timbral
variation are important parts of the composition. RP-8’s screen is full
of dials and switches that you can use to alter the character of your
sound.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/sound_design.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="All of RP-8’s sound design controls, highlighted" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">All of RP-8’s sound design controls,
highlighted</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll notice that some of these controls are located on the devices
and some are located in the header section. The controls located on each
device control their respective devices only, the controls in the header
section control the effects units, how the device sounds are processed
and mixed, and (in song mode) the song’s position, arrangement, and loop
mode.</p>
<h2 id="saving-and-loading">Saving And Loading</h2>
<p>RP-8 can save songs, load songs, export audio, and load samples for
playback. Most of RP-8’s save and load functionality is provided through
the Pico-8 pause menu, which you can access by pressing
<strong>enter</strong>. Navigate this menu with the arrow keys, and
press <strong>enter</strong> again to make a selection.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">The <strong>continue</strong> option will let you exit
the menu without taking any action.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<figure>
<img src="img/pause_menu.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="The pause menu" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The pause menu</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="saving-and-loading-songs">Saving and Loading Songs</h3>
<p>You can save your work to the clipboard by selecting <strong>save to
clip</strong>. This will copy the current state of your song to the
clipboard. If you want to save to a file, open up any text editor and
paste the contents of the clipboard there. If you are using Pico-8 on
the web, you may also be prompted to press ctrl-C to complete the copy
operation.</p>
<p>You can load a song by copying it to the system clipboard, then
pasting it into RP-8 with ctrl-V (or cmd-V if you’re using a Mac), then
selecting <strong>load from clip</strong> from the pause menu. If RP-8
crashes or if nothing happens when you load, make sure that you
correctly copied the whole save data string - RP-8 may not behave
properly if you load an invalid save.</p>
<h3 id="checkpointing-with-the-clipboard">Checkpointing with the
Clipboard</h3>
<p>You can use the save/load operations to quickly checkpoint your
progress. If you select <strong>save to clip</strong>, then the next
time you select <strong>load from clip</strong> you will load from that
save. It’s a good idea to save before any major experiments or editing
operations so you can quickly reload if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>You should also save to a file periodically, since your checkpoint
will be lost if you close RP-8 or if it crashes.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-audio">Exporting Audio</h3>
<p>To export audio, select <strong>start export</strong> from the pause
menu. RP-8 will begin recording its main output to a file. Play your
song, do a little improvisation, or whatever you want to record. When
you’re done, go back to the pause menu and select <strong>stop
export</strong>. Your recording will now be in a WAV file on your
desktop.</p>
<p>The output file is not written until you select <strong>stop
export</strong>, so remember to do that before you quit RP-8 - otherwise
you will lose your recording.</p>
<h3 id="loading-samples">Loading Samples</h3>
<p>Each RP-8 song can store one audio sample, which you can play using
the SP (<strong>S</strong>ample <strong>P</strong>layback) track on the
drum machine. First, choose your sample, and convert it to mono 5512kHz
8-bit unsigned raw PCM. You can do this with <a
href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, with <a
href="https://bikibird.itch.io/">bikibird</a>’s excellent <a
href="https://bikibird.itch.io/defy">Defy</a> utility,<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If you use Defy, select the <strong>Unsigned 8-bit
PCM</strong> output format, and make sure the <strong>Apply Antialiasing
Filter</strong> option is checked.<br />
<br />
</span></span> or with your audio editor of choice. Once you have
converted the sample, just drop the file onto RP-8 to load it into your
song. If your sample is longer than about 5.9 seconds, RP-8 will
truncate it, and if you have a sample already loaded, loading a new
sample will replace it. You should now be able to play back your sample
as the 6th drum track!</p>
<h2 id="song-mode">Song Mode</h2>
<p>Now that you’re familiar with making sound and saving your work, it’s
time to start making songs. Song mode allows you to record parameter and
pattern changes over time, and exposes a few extra tools to make this
task easier. However, in exchange for automation, you sacrifice a little
bit of control:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>in pattern mode</strong>, you are in immediate direct
control of every part of RP-8’s sound. Every time you change a control,
that change will “stick” until you change that control again.</li>
<li><strong>in song mode</strong>, the sequencer is in control of
pattern selections and sound settings until you record new ones. You can
also temporarily override some settings, but those overrides will not be
permanent unless you explicitly commit them.</li>
</ul>
<p>While pattern selection and sound settings are handled differently
between the two modes, pattern <em>contents</em> - note and step data -
are shared. Changes to pattern content cannot be automated (if you want
different notes, choose a different pattern), and any changes to pattern
content in one mode will be immediately reflected in the other mode as
well.</p>
<p>This section will walk you through building up a 4-bar loop in song
mode, and then how to expand this loop into a full-fledged song.</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-song">Starting A Song</h3>
<p>While you can begin a song directly in song mode, it can be helpful
to start in pattern mode to sketch out a few starting patterns and dial
in some of your sound. When you’re ready, click the pattern/song mode
selector toggle, or use the <strong>tab</strong> key to switch into song
mode. The mode you’re in is reflected by whichever letter (P or S) is
brighter.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ps_mode_btn.png" style="width:6.25%"
alt="Pattern/song mode selector toggle" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pattern/song mode selector
toggle</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you enter song mode, you’ll notice a few new controls light up.
We’ll discuss most of these in more detail later - the important thing
to know is that right now RP-8 is set to play a 4-bar loop. If you hit
play, you’ll also notice that any sound changes you’ve made in pattern
mode haven’t been copied over, so let’s fix that now.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/seq_copy_paste_btns.png" style="width:6.25%"
alt="Sequence copy (top) and paste (bottom) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sequence copy (top) and paste (bottom)
buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Switch to pattern mode, and click the copy sequence button in the
header section. Then switch back to song mode and click the paste
sequence button. Your 4-bar loop has been filled with the settings from
pattern mode, which should form a good start for your song.</p>
<h3 id="transport-and-loop-controls">Transport and Loop Controls</h3>
<p>Let’s add a new section to the song. First, we’ll need to understand
how to use the transport controls at the top of the screen:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/transport.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Transport controls (from left): song position, loop enable, loop start, loop length" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Transport controls (from left): song
position, loop enable, loop start, loop length</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The position and loop controls are all bar numbers. Your song can
contain up to 999 bars. Each of these controls responds to drag inputs.
When the loop enable toggle is on, playing past the end of the last bar
of the loop will move the song position back to the beginning of the
loop. (If the song position is already beyond the end of the loop,
nothing will happen.)</p>
<p>The loop controls are extremely useful for a few reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>looping a section of your song allows you to focus on it for
editing,</li>
<li>looping while live recording adjustments allows you to try multiple
takes to get the right sound (more on this later), and</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, all of the sequence edit buttons (like
copy and paste above) act only on the current loop. This is true even if
loop mode is disabled.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If you want to edit the entire song, adjust your loop
so it includes the whole song.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Since we want to add a new section, let’s set the loop so it covers
the next 4 bars: that’s a loop start of 5 and a length of 4. Go to
pattern mode, pick out some new pattern selections and sound settings,
click <strong>copy sequence</strong>, switch back to song mode, and
click <strong>paste sequence</strong>. Your new section should be ready
- these sections now fill bars 5 through 8. If you adjust the loop start
to 1 and loop length to 8, you should be able to loop your whole song
(such as it is at this point).</p>
<h3 id="adjusting-sound-with-parameter-overrides">Adjusting Sound with
Parameter Overrides</h3>
<p>Play your song, and then start adjusting some of the sound controls.
You’ll notice that the record button at the top of the screen turns from
dull red to yellow. You’ll also notice these two buttons light up:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/override_btns.png" style="width:12.5%"
alt="Override discard (left) and commit (right) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Override discard (left) and commit
(right) buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These changes indicate that you have made changes to the pattern
selections or sound settings that have <em>not yet</em> been committed
to the song. Whenever you touch a new control, RP-8 adds that control to
a list of overrides and will stop automating that control. It will leave
all these controls where you set them until:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You stop playback: the changes are discarded and overrides are
cleared. (No action is taken on <em>starting</em> playback, only on
stopping.)</li>
<li>You click the discard button: the changes are discarded, overrides
are cleared, and parameter settings will reset to their recorded values
at the start of the next bar. This is just like stopping playback,
except you can leave the song playing.</li>
<li>You click the commit button: the changes are applied to the current
loop and overrides are cleared. These changes <em>do not</em> include
any automation, only the constant current values of the touched controls
are used.</li>
<li>You start recording changes - see <a
href="#recording-changes">Recording Changes</a> for more details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Parameter overrides are very useful for exploring adjustments to the
sound of whole sections of your song at once. The idea that RP-8 keeps
track of which controls you’ve touched, and records adjustments for only
those controls, is also good to keep in mind in the other recording
modes.</p>
<h3 id="recording-changes">Recording Changes</h3>
<p>The adjust/commit workflow in the previous section is good for making
sweeping changes across large parts of your song at once. But for
finer-grained changes, we’ll want to use the record button. There are
two different ways to use the record button: step recording (making
changes while paused), and real-time recording (making changes while
playing). Step recording is good for making changes to single bars at a
time,<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">This is especially useful for quickly sequencing
pattern changes.<br />
<br />
</span></span> while real-time recording is the only way to record
changes in the middle of a bar.</p>
<p>Whether you are step recording or real-time recording, you will want
to remember from the previous section the idea that RP-8 tracks which
controls you have touched in a recording session. RP-8 will not modify
any control or record new values for it until you touch that control.
Once you do so, RP-8 stops automating the control and starts recording
changes to it. When you exit recording mode or stop playback, the set of
touched controls is cleared.</p>
<p>You begin <strong>step recording</strong> by clicking the record
button while RP-8 is paused. The record button will become bright red,
indicating that RP-8 is now recording. When you modify a control, you
set its value for the current bar. When you navigate to a new bar, every
touched control’s value is set for that bar. Note that this means that
skimming through lots of bars with record mode enabled is very
dangerous! Consider using the up and down arrow keys to navigate through
the song with increased precision. When you are done, click the record
button again to turn off recording.</p>
<p>To begin <strong>real-time recording</strong>, navigate to the bar at
which you wish to start recording, click the record button, and then
begin playback. Adjust sounds with the mouse and keyboard as you
normally would. If you stop playback and replay the bars that you
recorded, your adjustments will be played back just as you made them.
(Although if you stop partway through a bar, note that the whole bar’s
automation is replaced, not just up to the note at which you
stopped.)</p>
<p>Touched controls are handled a little differently in real-time
recording when looping is enabled: the set of touched controls is
cleared when the song loops. This makes it easier to layer changes, to
retry a recording that didn’t go as planned, and to make sure that you
don’t overwrite any parameter settings you didn’t mean to.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-arrangement-editing">Advanced Arrangement Editing</h3>
<p>There are still a few song mode controls that we have not covered,
and some additional subtleties to the controls we discussed earlier.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Copy sequence</dt>
<dd>
<p>Copies the current pattern and control settings (if in pattern mode)
or loop, including all automation (if in song mode).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cut sequence</dt>
<dd>
<p>Acts identically to copy sequence, except it removes the current
loop’s bars from the song. Later bars are moved up to fill the empty
space.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Paste sequence</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fills the current loop with the last copied sequence. If the copied
sequence is shorter than the current loop, it is repeated to fit. If the
copied sequence is longer, it is truncated. Sequences copied from
pattern mode are treated as one-bar loops with no automation, and
sequences pasted into pattern mode use only the first bar (and no
automation).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Insert sequence</dt>
<dd>
<p>Inserts new bars into the song to fill the current loop, so that the
loop’s old contents are now located just after the loop. The new bars
are then filled with the copied sequence, just as with paste.</p>
</dd>
