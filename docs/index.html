<p>RP-8 is a Pico-8 demake of Propellerhead Software’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-338">ReBirth RB-338</a>.
Like the original, it provides two synth voices, drums, pattern-based
sequencing, effects, a pattern mode for immediate hands-on control, and
a song mode for recording music. Unlike the original, the audio output
is crunchy 8 bit 5.5kHz mono sound, and the user interface is rendered
in 16 colors at a chunky 128x128 resolution.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying RP-8, and let me know if you have any
thoughts!<span

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<h2 id="your-first-song">Your First Song</h2>
<p>This section will walk you through writing a simple song in RP-8:
everything you need to know to make your own music. There are two main
things you’ll learn: how to compose music in pattern mode, and how to
arrange it in song mode. This workflow closely resembles how I begin new
tracks in RP-8, and it might be a good starting point for you too.</p>
<p>If you have never used ReBirth before, I highly recommend you follow
this tutorial, as it introduces several important ideas that are
foundational to how RP-8 works. If you have used ReBirth, it’s still
probably a good idea to at least skim the tutorial, since RP-8 does not
function identically to ReBirth.</p>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="pattern-mode-composing-and-experimenting">Pattern Mode:
Composing and Experimenting</h2>
<p>In RP-8, you compose music by writing patterns, which are sequences
of up to 16 notes that you can play back in various orders to make
songs. RP-8 starts up in pattern mode, which gives you direct control
over every aspect of what RP-8 does, and is perfect for basic
composition tasks and experimenting with sound design.</p>
<h3 id="make-a-drum-pattern">Make A Drum Pattern</h3>
<p>Drums are never a bad place to start, so let’s make a drum pattern.
The drum machine is at the bottom of the screen and looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/drums_empty.png" alt="The drum machine" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The drum machine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the bottom of the drum machine are the step buttons, which control
what kind of sound (if any) plays on each step. Click a few step buttons
- you’ll see that they light up - then click the play button at the
top-left of the screen. You should hear a bass drum playing the steps
that you clicked.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/drum_btn_colors.png" style="width:31.25%"
alt="Different drum step colors" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Different drum step colors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You may have noticed that the buttons can light up in different
colors. For the drum machine, red and yellow are different variations of
the sound, and the intensity of the light indicates the volume of the
hit (brighter means louder). You can click a button multiple times to
cycle through the options.</p>
<p>You have probably also noticed that the <strong>BD</strong> button on
the drum machine is lit. There are 5 other similar buttons, each
representing a different drum. If you click one, you’ll see that the
steps get cleared: this is because you’re now editing a different drum
in the same pattern.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Make a drum pattern using all 6 drums.</p>
<h3 id="make-a-synth-pattern">Make A Synth Pattern</h3>
<p>You should be all set for drums at this point, at least for one bar.
How about a melody or a bassline? For this you’ll probably want to use
one of the two synths, which look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/synth_empty.png" alt="A synth" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A synth</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like the drum machine, these have step buttons, but below the step
buttons are note controls, which control what pitch the synth plays at
each step. You can drag up and down on the note controls to change which
note plays on each step.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Try making a one-bar melody.</p>
<p>Like the drum machine, the step buttons light up in different colors,
but the meaning of the red and yellow colors is different. Red steps
play notes as normal, but yellow steps are <em>slides</em>. Slide notes
are longer and allow you to smoothly slide between pitch on adjacent
steps. Dimmer steps are played normally, brighter steps are
accented.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">RP-8 tries to approximate the accent behavior of the
TB-303, but it’s a loose resemblance at best.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h3 id="name-and-save-your-song">Name and Save Your Song</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve done some work, it’s probably good to save your song
so you don’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>TASK</strong>: Press <code>f</code> or click on the disk icon
to bring up the file menu, then use the arrow keys to navigate down to
<strong>Rename Song</strong>, then press enter to open the song rename
screen.. Enter a name for your song, and then (once you are back at the
main RP-8 screen) press <code>s</code> to save your song. The song has
been saved to the folder that RP-8 is in. To open this folder, you can
go back to the file menu with <code>f</code> and select <strong>Open
Folder</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also press <code>p</code> to quicksave your song to the
clipboard. This is useful for quickly checkpointing your work. RP-8 does
not have undo, so use this feature often, especially before you make
changes you’re not sure about! You can press <code>o</code> to quickload
from the clipboard.</p>
<h3 id="check-out-the-integrated-help">Check Out the Integrated
Help</h3>
<p>By now you have probably noticed that RP-8 uses hotkeys for many
features. You can press <code>h</code> at any point to view a help
screen with a list of hotkeys (and the URL to this user guide).</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/rp8_help.2048.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="The RP-8 help screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The RP-8 help screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also press <code>t</code> in the main view to toggle tooltips
on and off.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Try turning on tooltips and checking out some
of the control labels.</p>
<h3 id="change-the-sound">Change the Sound</h3>
<p>Ok, let’s get back to making music. You’ve made a couple of loops,
but you might find that the overall sound is a little … uninspiring. The
good news is that you can make it better! RP-8 is packed with sound
design controls.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/sound_design.png" style="width:70.0%"
alt="All of RP-8’s sound design controls, highlighted" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">All of RP-8’s sound design controls,
highlighted</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Both the synths and the drum machines have tons of knobs that affect
the character of the sounds that they make, and the section at the top
of the screen lets you mix and apply effects to these sounds. Use can
use tooltips for more information on what each knob does.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Play around with the sound and dial in
something you like!</p>
<h3 id="make-more-patterns">Make More Patterns</h3>
<p>RP-8 supports multiple patterns to allow for variations and longer
phrases. You can switch between patterns using the pattern and bank
selector buttons:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ptn_bank_btns.png" style="width:25.0%"
alt="Bank selector and pattern buttons. The current pattern is highlighted." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bank selector and pattern buttons. The
current pattern is highlighted.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There 8 banks (A-H) of 6 patterns each. You can drag on the bank
selector to change banks, and click the number buttons to pick a pattern
in the bank. If RP-8 is paused, the pattern will change instantly, if it
is playing, then the pattern will change at the beginning of the next
bar.</p>
<p>If you get lost and can’t figure out which bank the current pattern
is in, you can press <code>b</code> at any time to jump each bank
selector to the current pattern’s bank.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ptn_copy_paste_btns.png" style="width:12.5%"
alt="Pattern copy (left) and paste (right) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pattern copy (left) and paste (right)
buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you want to make a new variation of a pattern, you can use the
pattern copy/paste buttons on the synths and the drum machine to
duplicate a pattern to a new slot for further editing. You can copy
patterns between the two synths, but not between the synths and the drum
machine.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Make a few more patterns: maybe a bassline on
one synth, a few bars worth of melody on the other synth, and one or two
drum loop variations on the drum machine.</p>
<p>If you’re having fun - keep going! It’ll be helpful to be fairly
comfortable in pattern mode before moving on to arrangement in song
mode.</p>
<h2 id="song-mode-arranging-and-automating">Song Mode: Arranging and
Automating</h2>
<p>Sometimes one bar of music just isn’t enough. That’s when it’s time
for song mode, which allows you to arrange multiple bars of music and
record control movements. You can switch into song mode using the mode
selector button, or by pressing <code>m</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/ps_mode_btn.png" style="width:6.25%"
alt="Pattern/song mode selector button" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pattern/song mode selector
button</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The most important change from song mode to pattern mode is that you
are no longer in direct control of the sound design or of which patterns
are playing.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Note that this does not include pattern contents (notes
and steps). These are shared with pattern mode, and changing them still
works exactly like pattern mode.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Instead, the RP-8 sequencer controls these, and any
changes you make will be lost until you take special steps to record
them. The sections below explain three different recording methods you
can use.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if this doesn’t make total sense yet. Let’s start
arranging our song, and everything should become clearer in the
process.</p>
<h3 id="choose-a-loop-length">Choose A Loop Length</h3>
<p>In song mode, you’ll find song position and loop controls at the top
of the screen. Each control’s value is measured in bars:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/transport.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="Transport controls (from left): song position, loop enable, loop start, loop length. Drag the numbers to change them." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Transport controls (from left): song
position, loop enable, loop start, loop length. Drag the numbers to
change them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These controls are essential in song mode. Not only do these controls
let you choose which part of the song you are play back, but the loop
controls also act as a “selection” in the song: there are many
operations in RP-8 that perform an operation only on the bars contained
in the current loop.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Since we are starting a new song, let’s set
our loop to start at bar 1<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">It’s okay to start at bar 1 even if we think we might
want to add an introduction, there are ways to move bars around
later.<br />
<br />
</span></span> and be either 4 or 8 bars long.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If you forget which control is loop start and which is
loop length, you can turn on tooltips with <code>t</code> for a
reminder.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h3 id="copy-a-loop-from-pattern-mode">Copy A Loop From Pattern
Mode</h3>
<p>You’ve probably noticed that, in song mode, all your sound edits from
pattern mode have been lost. Instead of recreating them manually, let’s
copy them over. You’ll that there are copy/paste buttons not just on
each device, but also near the top of the screen:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/seq_copy_paste_btns.png" style="width:6.25%"
alt="Sequence copy (top) and paste (bottom) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sequence copy (top) and paste (bottom)
buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can use these buttons to copy information about all the sound
controls.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Switch back to pattern mode (by clicking the
mode button or pressing <code>m</code>) and click the copy button, then
switch back to song mode, and click the paste button. Your loop should
now be filled with the same control configuration you had in pattern
mode!</p>
<h3 id="recording-3-ways">Recording, 3 Ways</h3>
<p>We’re now going to use three different recording methods to build up
some changes and structure in your loop.</p>
<h3 id="change-the-sound-again">Change the Sound (Again)</h3>
<p>This section demonstrates the first recording method:
change-and-commit.</p>
<p>Try playing your new loop. (Make sure the loop enable control is
turned on.) Now try changing some of the controls. You’ll notice that
your changes look like they stay in effect … until you pause playback.
Then all your changes are reset. You may also have noticed that the dark
red record button next to the play button turns yellow when you start
making changes. What’s going on here?</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/record_btn_states.png" style="width:25.0%"
alt="Record button states: disabled (pattern mode), no changes, uncommitted changes, recording" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Record button states: disabled (pattern
mode), no changes, uncommitted changes, recording</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you start making changes, RP-8 notices that you’ve departed from
the recorded sequence, and turns the record light yellow to warn you.
Any controls you have changed will stay where you left them, but any
controls you have not touched will stay under sequencer control. When
you pause playback, RP-8 puts all controls back under sequencer control
and resets their values.</p>
<p>But what if you like your changes?</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/override_btns.png" style="width:12.5%"
alt="Change discard (left) and commit (right) buttons" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Change discard (left) and commit (right)
buttons</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whenver you have uncommitted changes (i.e. the record button is
yellow) the change discard/commit buttons will light up. The discard
button clears your changes, just like stopping playback.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If RP-8 is playing, control values will reset at the
start of the next bar, if it is paused, they will reset
immediately.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The commit button, on the other hand, will keep your
changes: each control you have modified will now keep its current
position everywhere in your loop.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">But only its current position - if you want more
flexible recording, you’ll have to read on.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Try making some more changes to the sound in
your loop. Then use the loop controls to select one or two bars within
your loop, and change the sound only in those bars. Set your loop back
to its original length again and listen to your new control
automation!</p>
<h3 id="automate-the-sound">Automate the Sound</h3>
<p>This section demonstrates the second recording method: realtime
recording.</p>
<p>The technique above is easy, but only lets you make changes in
full-bar chunks. If you want a nice filter sweep, you’ll have to use
realtime recording instead. When you turn on record mode, by clicking
the record button or pressing <code>r</code>, the record button will
light up bright red, and RP-8 will begin immediately recording all
control changes you make to the song.</p>
<p>If looping is enabled, RP-8 will forget about all changed controls
each time playback loops. This allows you to record automation for
multiple controls in the same recording session, and means that you
don’t have to quickly hit stop to avoid recording over the start of your
loop.</p>
<p>When you pause playback, RP-8 will automatically exit record mode.
You can also exit record mode by clicking the record button.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Press <code>p</code> to quicksave your song in
case something goes wrong or you record something you don’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Go to the beginning of your loop, enable
recording, and hit play. Move the synth filter cutoff knobs. Each time
the song loops is a new take, so keep trying as long as you like!</p>
<h3 id="sequence-your-patterns">Sequence Your Patterns</h3>
<p>This section demonstrates the third recording method: step
recording.</p>
<p>We’re now going to record some pattern changes in your loop. You
could do this using either of the previous two methods, but for pattern
recording you often want to set patterns across many bars quickly. This
is easy to do with step recording. When record mode is active, any
changed controls are written to any bar you visit, <em>even when
paused</em>. This means that you can enable recording, make some
changes, and step forward or backward in the song to write those changes
to each new bar.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Press <code>p</code> to quicksave.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Sequence all the pattern changes you want in
your loop! Go to the first bar of your loop and enter record mode. Then
select the patterns you want to play on that bar. Then use the the
<code>.</code> key to move one bar forward and select the patterns you
want to play on that bar. If you want to keep the same patterns for
multiple bars, you can just skip through them, you do not need to click
the pattern buttons again.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">You can also use the mouse to drag the song position
control to navigate, but you need to be careful. Every control modified
in the current recording session will be written to every bar you visit!
You can easily overwrite many bars worth of sequencer data if you’re not
careful.<br />
<br />
</span></span> If you make a mistake, you can backtrack with the
<code>,</code> key to fix it, or if you make a big mistake, press
<code>o</code> to quickload your last checkpoint.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now have a fully-sequenced loop. Let’s finish
this all off by copying your loop and making a variation.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-your-loop">Duplicate Your Loop</h3>
<p>To make major changes to the arrangement, we need to use the song
editing tools near the top of the screen. Two of these, copy and paste,
should be familiar from earlier, since we used them to initialize our
loop from patern mode.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/song_edit_btns.png" style="width:12.5%"
alt="Song edit buttons, clockwise from top left: copy, cut, insert, paste" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Song edit buttons, clockwise from top
left: copy, cut, insert, paste</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All of these features use the current loop as their active
selection.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Click the copy button to copy the current
loop. Then click the insert button, which will insert the copied bars
into the current loop, moving the current loop and all later bars back
to make space. You have just created a duplicate of the loop! Keeping
the loop length the same, advance the loop start to the end of the
current loop, so we can start editing the duplicated content.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Use what you have learned so far to write a B
section to this tiny song!</p>
<h3 id="create-an-aba-structure">Create an ABA Structure</h3>
<p>Let’s do one more sequence edit, to add a copy of the original loop
at the end of your B section, for a very brief ABA structure.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Move the loop back to the beginning of the
song, and copy your original loop. Then advance your loop point just
past your B section and click paste.</p>
<h3 id="export-to-audio">Export To Audio</h3>
<p>All right, we’re ready to finish this off! Now we just need to use
the .WAV export feature to render your song to audio. There are two
steps: first, prep your song for export by creating a few silent bars at
the end. Then just enable export and play your song from the start.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Add some silent bars at the end of your song.
Move the loop past the end of the song and use change+commit recording
to disable all three instruments for this section (click the red circle
on the left side of the instrument to toggle whether it is enabled).
Leave this loop enabled at the end of the song - you want to “trap” the
playback position here after export so you don’t get unexpected sounds
at the end of your recording.</p>
<p><strong>TASK:</strong> Go back to the beginning of your song, and,
while paused, press <code>e</code> to enable export. Then play your song
to the end, and press <code>e</code> when done. You’ll see a new .WAV
file on your desktop containing your exported audio.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just made a very short song with RP-8. Go

<p>This section is extremely incomplete</p>
<h2 id="devices">Devices</h2>
<p>Sound in RP-8 is generated by its 3 devices: two identical
2-ocillator synthesizers loosely inspired by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TB-303">Roland TB-303</a> and
one drum machine that is even more loosely inspired by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808">Roland TR-808</a>.
These devices are explained in more detail in their own sections.</p>

<p>In general, you should use the synthesizers for tonal elements in
your songs, like melody or bass lines, and you should use the drum
machine for rhythmic elements. However, all the drums have a tuning
adjustment knob, and many of the sounds can have a strong tonal
character, so stay open-minded!<span

class="sidenote">TR-808 bass drums with long decay times are often used
as bass sounds. The FM and percussion tracks of the drum machine can
also easily be used as additional tonal voices.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Each device is controlled by a pattern sequencer, which
plays back sequences of notes or drum hits from a user-programmable bank
of patterns. Patterns are 16 step (1 bar) series of notes or drum hits,
and are the building blocks of music in RP-8.</p>
<p>RP-8 also has a header section at the top of the display, which
houses controls that affect the whole song or pattern: the song/pattern
mode switch, song transport controls, effects controls, and the
mixer.</p>

<h2 id="modes">Modes</h2>
<p>RP-8 has two modes: <strong>pattern mode</strong> and <strong>song
mode</strong>. All the same devices and sound creation machinery are
available in both, however, they have different purposes. Pattern mode
gives you immediate direct control of every parameter, so it is ideal
for learning, experimentation, and coming up with new ideas. Song mode
records enables several features for recording, editing, and replay of
parameter changes, and so is best for when you want to start recording
multi-bar sequences and complex automation.</p>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>The RP-8 UI also has two sequencer pages, each accessible in both
pattern and song modes. You can toggle between them with the
<code>tab</code> key, or by clicking the <code>P1</code> /
<code>P2</code> button near the top of the screen. Each page shows a
different set of pitch controls for each pattern.</p>
<p>RP-8 starts on page 1. This page lets you control the pitch of
oscillator 1 on both synths, and shows the drum pattern step
buttons.</p>
<p>Page 2 contains secondary / relative pitch controls. These controls
let you detune each drum (on the drum machine) or the second oscillator
(on each synth) relative to the main pitch for each device. For the
synth, this means you are detuning oscillator 2 relative to oscillator
1. For the drums, you are detuning each drum relative to whatever pitch
is determined by the sound controls. (The base pitch of each drum with
all knobs at their default positions is usually G in some octave.)</p>

automation).</p>

<h2 id="audio-routing">Audio Routing</h2>
<figure>
<img src="img/orig/audio_arch.png" alt="The RP-8 audio architecture" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The RP-8 audio architecture</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each of the two synthesizers and the drum machine is routed into its
own overdrive unit. The overdrive outputs are sent to the mixer, which
separately mixes these voices into a dry signal and a delay send signal.
The delay send signal is sent to the delay effect, whose output is then
mixed with the dry signal and sent to the compressor. Finally, soft
saturation is applied to the signal before it is output to the
speaker.</p>
<p>This routing can be varied in two ways:</p>
<h2 id="synths">Synths</h2>
<h2 id="drum-machine">Drum Machine</h2>
<p>The drum machine offers six different drum tracks. Each track offers
two different drum sounds, each at two different volume levels. Sound
selection is indicated by step color: one sound is red, one sound is
yellow. Sound intensity is indicated by button light intensity: brighter
steps are louder, or accented.</p>
<p>Each sound has two different controls: <strong>Tn</strong> (tune) and
<strong>Dc</strong> (decay). These controls work slightly differently
for each sound. Each track also has its own step pattern with its own
length, and you can use step patterns of different lengths to create
polyrhythms. The drums can be transposed by semitone in the second
sequencer page.</p>
<p>By default, all of the six tracks are processed through the overdrive
and delay effects, as well as the pattern filter if its source is set to
DR. You can cycle through the <strong>FX</strong> button settings for
each pair of tracks to turn on or off the effects for each track
separately. When effects are bypassed for a track, that track is not
processed by overdrive, not processed by the pattern filter (if the
pattern filter is set to <strong>DR</strong> mode), and not sent to the
delay send bus.</p>
<h3 id="bass-drum-bd">Bass Drum (BD)</h3>
<p>The bass drum sounds use simple waveforms that start out at high
volume and pitch, then rapidly decay to low volume and low pitch. The
<strong>Tn</strong> knob controls the starting pitch, and the
<strong>Dc</strong> knob controls now rapidly the volume and pitch
decay. When not transposed, the ending pitch is approximately 49 Hz
(G1). Transposing the drums affects both the starting and ending
pitch.</p>
<p><strong>Red sound:</strong> This is an approximately 808-style bass
drum using a sine wave and simple exponential envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow sound:</strong> This is closer to a 909-style bass
drum. It uses a triangle wave, and the exponential envelopes are limited
at the start of the drum hit, in order to approximate a compressed
sound.</p>
<h3 id="snare-drum-sd">Snare Drum (SD)</h3>
<p>The snare drum mixes a sine wave exponentially decaying in pitch and
volume, like the bass drum, with exponentially decaying noise. This
whole signal is then sent through a gentle highpass filter. The
<strong>Tn</strong> knob controls the pitch of the sine wave, and the
<strong>Dc</strong> knob controls the decay time of the envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>Red sound:</strong> This is a short, snappy, noisy snare
drum. The tonal sine wave component is fairly quiet, and the decay times
are relatively short.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow sound:</strong> This is a slightly heavier, darker
snare. The tonal component is louder, the decay is longer, and the
highpass filter is set slightly lower to retain more midrange
frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="hihat-hh">Hihat (HH)</h3>
<p>The hihat is a short burst of noise, mixed with several high-pitch
detuned square waves at inharmonic frequency ratios. All of these are
highpass filtered, and decay exponentially in volume. The
<strong>Tn</strong> knob controls the pitch of the square waves, and the
<strong>Dc</strong> knob controls the decay time. Both closed and open
hihats are on this track, so playing a closed hihat will cut off an open
hihat sound (and vice versa), allowing you to achieve a classic hihat
choke effect.</p>
<p><strong>Red sound:</strong> This is a closed hihat with shorter
decay.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow sound</strong> This is an open hihat, with a longer
decay.</p>
<h3 id="cymbal-cy">Cymbal (CY)</h3>
<p>The cymbal sound is generated identically to the hihat
(<strong>HH</strong>) sound, but this track is tuned for longer decay
times and slightly higher pitches. The knobs work identically to the
hihat knobs. Like the hihats, the cymbals will mute each other - this is
not a typical effect, but try it out and see what happens!</p>
<p><strong>Red sound:</strong> This is a cymbal with a shorter decay,
like a ride.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow sound:</strong> This is a cymbal with a longer decay,
like a crash.</p>
<h3 id="percussion-pc">Percussion (PC)</h3>
<p>This sound is synthesized identically to the bass drum
(<strong>BD</strong>), but at higher pitches and with shorter decay
times. By changing the tuning you can create sounds similar to toms,
congas, rimshots, and more. Play around and see what you get!</p>
<p><strong>Red sound:</strong> Same as <strong>BD</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow sound:</strong> Same as <strong>BD</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="fm-fm">FM (FM)</h3>
<p>This is an FM sound made from two sine wave operators. You can use
this to make metallic or other tonal percussive sounds. The pitches of
each operator remain constant during each drum hit, but both the volume
and the amount of modulation decay exponentially. The
<strong>Tn</strong> knob controls the operator frequency ratio, and the
<strong>Dc</strong> knob controls the envelope decay times.</p>
<p>The frequency ratios range from 1/4 (at the bottom end of the knob
range) to 4 (at the top end of the range). Each increment of 32 in the
knob value doubles the frequency ratio, so the default position of 64
corresponds to a frequency ratio of 1, and <strong>Tn</strong> knob
values that are multiples of 8, 16, or 32 will produce less dissonant
sounds. Try the <strong>shift+up arrow</strong> and <strong>shift+down
arrow</strong> hotkeys to step through <strong>Tn</strong> knob settings
in steps of 16.</p>
<p><strong>Red sound:</strong> Light modulation intensity, producing
cleaner, simpler sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow sound:</strong> Heavy modulation intensity producing
harsher, more complex sounds.</p>
<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>RP-8 contains several effects to help shape the sound of the synths
and drum machine. Please refer to the audio routing diagram from the <a
href="#audio-routing">Audio Routing</a> section for more
information.</p>
<h3 id="overdrive">Overdrive</h3>
<p>There are three overdrive units, one for each of the two synths and
for the drum machine. Each one independently distorts the audio for its
device. The <strong>OD</strong> knobs in the mixer section control the
intensity of the overdrive effect for each device, and the
<strong>ODS</strong> knob (<strong>O</strong>ver<strong>D</strong>rive
<strong>S</strong>hape) controls the tone and color of all three
overdrive units. Higher values produce thinner, scratchier overdriven
tones with more odd harmonics.</p>
<h3 id="delay">Delay</h3>
<p>The delay unit is a tempo-synced digital delay on a shared send bus.
The delay times can be set in 16th notes (shown as number of 16th notes,
1-16), 16th note triplets (shown as 1T-16T), or dotted 16th notes (a
number of 16th notes plus a 32nd note, shown as 0D-15D). The
<strong>FB</strong> control controls the amount of delay feedback. There
is a small amount of highpass filtering in the delay feedback loop so
the delayed sound does not become too muddy.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-filter">Pattern Filter</h3>
<p>The pattern filter is a 2 pole state variable filter with lowpass and
bandpass modes. It differs from the other effects in that it can take
its signal from several possible different sources. These are controlled
by the <strong>SRC</strong> control. The possible sources are <strong>-
-</strong>, or disabled, <strong>S1</strong>, <strong>S2</strong>, and
<strong>DR</strong>, for the synths and the drum machine, and
<strong>MA</strong>, for the main audio output after the mixer.</p>
<p>The <strong>MD</strong> control selects the filter mode: lowpass
(shelf shaped) or bandpass (peaked). <strong>FRQ</strong> controls the
cutoff frequency, <strong>RES</strong> the resonance,
<strong>PT</strong> selects the filter pattern, and <strong>AMT</strong>
and <strong>DEC</strong> affect how that filter pattern is applied.</p>
<p>The filter patterns control a filter modulation envelope. Each
pattern is a different sequence of triggers of different intensities and
timings. Different patterns have different lengths: some are 16 steps,
and so line up neatly with the bar length, but other patterns are odd
lengths that can help you create complex rhythmic effects. The
<strong>AMT</strong> knob controls how strong the pattern triggers are:
if the knob is all the way up, the strongest triggers will always bring
the filter up to its maximum frequency (at least momentarily). If the
knob is all the way down, the pattern will have no effect. The
<strong>DEC</strong> knob controls the filter envelope decay time.</p>
<h3 id="compressor">Compressor</h3>
<p>The compressor is applied last of all RP-8’s effects. There is only
one control, the <strong>CT</strong> knob, which controls the compressor
threshold. By default, the knob is all the way up, which means that the
compressor will rarely have any effect. Reducing the compressor
threshold should help make your song sound more even in volume, and
should help your drum sounds and synth sounds fit together better.
There’s just one knob - try adjusting it and see if you like the
results!</p>
<p>The technical details: this compressor uses linear scaling (not
logarithmic) with a hard knee, a fixed ratio of 4, and fixed attack and
release times of approximately 2.5ms and 60ms, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-controls">Keyboard Controls</h2>
<p>You can press <code>h</code> at any time to get a list of these
shortcuts in RP-8. If keyboard shortcuts appear to not be working, check
to see if you have caps lock enabled: these shortcuts only work with
caps lock off.</p>
