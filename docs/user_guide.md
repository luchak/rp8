# Introduction

RP-8 is a Pico-8 demake of Propellerhead Software's [ReBirth
RB-338](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-33://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-338), one of the first
commercially successful software synthesizers. Like the original, it provides two synth voices, drums, pattern-based
sequencing, effects to enrich the sound, a pattern mode for immediate hands-on control, and a song mode for recording
music.

Unlike the original, the audio output is 8 bit 5.5kHz mono sound, and the user interface is rendered in glorious
128x128 4-bit color.

This guide will introduce you to the instrument, its major features and underlying concepts, and how to go about
designing sounds and composing songs.
