# Introduction

RP-8 is a Pico-8 demake of Propellerhead Software's [ReBirth
RB-338](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-33://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-338), one of the first
commercially successful software synthesizers. Like the original, it provides two synth voices, drums, pattern-based
sequencing, effects to enrich the sound, a pattern mode for immediate hands-on control, and a song mode for recording
music.

This guide will introduce you to the instrument, its major features and underlying concepts, and how to go about
designing sounds and composing songs.

Thank you for trying RP-8, and please don't hesitate to let me know what might make RP-8 more pleasant or interesting to
use. You can contact me at [luchak@gmail.com](mailto:luchak@gmail.com) or via the [RP-8
thread](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=47284) on the Lexaloffle BBS.
