RP-8 is a Pico-8 demake of Propellerhead Software's [ReBirth RB-338](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBirth_RB-338).
Like the original, it provides two synth voices, drums, pattern-based sequencing, effects, a pattern mode for immediate
hands-on control, and a song mode for recording music. Unlike the original, the audio output is crunchy 8-bit 5.5kHz
mono sound, and the user interface is rendered in 16 colors at a chunky 128x128 resolution.

This guide is written in two main parts: a [tutorial](tutorial.md) section that walks you through writing a short song
in RP-8, and a [reference](reference.md) section that explains the different main components of RP-8 in more detail. If
you ever get lost, remember that you can toggle tooltips on and off with `t`, and access keyboard shortcut reminders
with `h`.

Thanks for trying RP-8, and please feel free to [get in touch!](contact.md)
