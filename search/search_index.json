There are also a few buttons for manipulating pattern data that respond to vertical drags (the transpose and rotate pattern buttons).</p> <p>When you click or drag a control, it becomes highlighted in blue. This indicates that the control is now selected, and will respond to control-specific keyboard commands, such as the up and down arrow keys for altering step, note, or knob values.

This page lets you control the pitch of oscillator 1 on both synths, and shows the drum pattern step buttons.</p> <p>Page 2 shows secondary / relative pitch controls for all three devices. These controls let you detune each drum (on the drum machine) or the second oscillator (on each synth) relative to the main pitch for each device. For the synth, this means you are detuning oscillator 2 relative to oscillator 1. For the drums, you are detuning each drum relative to whatever pitch is determined by the sound controls.

Patterns are 16 step (1 bar) series of notes or drum hits, and are the building blocks of music in RP-8.</p> <p>RP-8 also has effects units and a mixer, whose controls are all located in the transport and mixer section at the top of the screen.</p> <p> </p> The transport and mixer section"},{"location":"reference/#audio-signal-flow","title":"Audio Signal Flow","text":"RP-8 audio signal flow <p>Each of the two synthesizers and the drum machine is routed into its own overdrive unit.

Each track offers two different drum sounds, each at two different volume levels. Sound selection is indicated by step color: one sound is red, one sound is yellow. Sound intensity is indicated by button light intensity: brighter steps are louder, or accented.</p> <p>Each sound has two different controls: Tn (tune) and Dc (decay). These controls work slightly differently for each sound. Each track also has its own step pattern with its own length, and you can use step patterns of different lengths to create polyrhythms. The drums can be transposed by semitone in the second sequencer page.</p> <p>By default, all of the six tracks are processed through the overdrive and delay effects, as well as the pattern filter if its source is set to DR. You can cycle through the FX button settings for each pair of tracks to turn on or off the effects for each track separately. When effects are bypassed for a track, that track is not processed by overdrive, not processed by the pattern filter (if the pattern filter is set to DR mode), and not sent to the delay send bus.</p> <p>Bass Drum (BD)</p> <p>The bass drum sounds use simple waveforms that start out at high volume and pitch, then rapidly decay to low volume and low pitch. The Tn knob controls the starting pitch, and the Dc knob controls now rapidly the volume and pitch decay. When not transposed, the ending pitch is approximately 49 Hz (G1). Transposing the drums affects both the starting and ending pitch.</p> <p>Red sound: This is an approximately 808-style bass drum using a sine wave and simple exponential envelopes.</p> <p>Yellow sound: This is closer to a 909-style bass drum. It uses a triangle wave, and the exponential envelopes are limited at the start of the drum hit, in order to approximate a compressed sound.</p> <p>Snare Drum (SD)</p> <p>The snare drum mixes a sine wave exponentially decaying in pitch and volume, like the bass drum, with exponentially decaying noise. This whole signal is then sent through a gentle highpass filter. The Tn knob controls the pitch of the sine wave, and the Dc knob controls the decay time of the envelopes.</p> <p>Red sound: This is a short, snappy, noisy snare drum. The tonal sine wave component is fairly quiet, and the decay times are relatively short.</p> <p>Yellow sound: This is a slightly heavier, darker snare. The tonal component is louder, the decay is longer, and the highpass filter is set slightly lower to retain more midrange frequencies.</p> <p>Hihat (HH)</p> <p>The hihat is a short burst of noise, mixed with several high-pitch detuned square waves at inharmonic frequency ratios. All of these are highpass filtered, and decay exponentially in volume. The Tn knob controls the pitch of the square waves, and the Dc knob controls the decay time. Both closed and open hihats are on this track, so playing a closed hihat will cut off an open hihat sound (and vice versa), allowing you to achieve a classic hihat choke effect.</p> <p>Red sound: This is a closed hihat with shorter decay.</p> <p>Yellow sound This is an open hihat, with a longer decay.</p> <p>Cymbal (CY)</p> <p>The cymbal sound is generated identically to the hihat (HH) sound, but this track is tuned for longer decay times and slightly higher pitches. The knobs work identically to the hihat knobs. Like the hihats, the cymbals will mute each other - this is not a typical effect, but try it out and see what happens!</p> <p>Red sound: This is a cymbal with a shorter decay, like a ride.</p> <p>Yellow sound: This is a cymbal with a longer decay, like a crash.</p> <p>Percussion (PC)</p> <p>This sound is synthesized identically to the bass drum (BD), but at higher pitches and with shorter decay times. By changing the tuning you can create sounds similar to toms, congas, rimshots, and more. Play around and see what you get!</p> <p>Red sound: Same as BD.</p> <p>Yellow sound: Same as BD.</p> <p>FM (FM)</p> <p>This is an FM sound made from two sine wave operators. You can use this to make metallic or other tonal percussive sounds. The pitches of each operator remain constant during each drum hit, but both the volume and the amount of modulation decay exponentially. The Tn knob controls the operator frequency ratio, and the Dc knob controls the envelope decay times.</p> <p>The frequency ratios range from 1/4 (at the bottom end of the knob range) to 4 (at the top end of the range). Each increment of 32 in the knob value doubles the frequency ratio, so the default position of 64 corresponds to a frequency ratio of 1, and Tn knob values that are multiples of 8, 16, or 32 will produce less dissonant sounds. Try the shift+up arrow and shift+down arrow hotkeys to step through Tn knob settings in steps of 16.</p> <p>Red sound: Light modulation intensity, producing cleaner, simpler sounds.</p> <p>Yellow sound: Heavy modulation intensity producing harsher, more complex sounds.</p>"},{"location":"reference/#effects","title":"Effects","text":"<p>RP-8 contains several effects to help shape the sound of the synths and drum machine. Please refer to the audio routing diagram from the [Audio Routing] section for more information.</p> <p>Overdrive</p> <p>There are three overdrive units, one for each of the two synths and for the drum machine. Each one independently distorts the audio for its device. The OD knobs in the mixer section control the intensity of the overdrive effect for each device, and the ODS knob (OverDrive Shape) controls the tone and color of all three overdrive units. Higher values produce thinner, scratchier overdriven tones with more odd harmonics.</p> <p>Delay</p> <p>The delay unit is a tempo-synced digital delay on a shared send bus. The delay times can be set in 16th notes (shown as number of 16th notes, 1-16), 16th note triplets (shown as 1T-16T), or dotted 16th notes (a number of 16th notes plus a 32nd note, shown as 0D-15D). The FB control controls the amount of delay feedback. There is a small amount of highpass filtering in the delay feedback loop so the delayed sound does not become too muddy.</p> <p>Pattern Filter</p> <p>The pattern filter is a 2 pole state variable filter with lowpass and bandpass modes. It differs from the other effects in that it can take its signal from several possible different sources. These are controlled by the SRC control. The possible sources are - -, or disabled, S1, S2, and DR, for the synths and the drum machine, and MA, for the main audio output after the mixer.</p> <p>The MD control selects the filter mode: lowpass (shelf shaped) or bandpass (peaked). FRQ controls the cutoff frequency, RES the resonance, PT selects the filter pattern, and AMT and DEC affect how that filter pattern is applied.</p> <p>The filter patterns control a filter modulation envelope. Each pattern is a different sequence of triggers of different intensities and timings. Different patterns have different lengths: some are 16 steps, and so line up neatly with the bar length, but other patterns are odd lengths that can help you create complex rhythmic effects. The AMT knob controls how strong the pattern triggers are: if the knob is all the way up, the strongest triggers will always bring the filter up to its maximum frequency (at least momentarily). If the knob is all the way down, the pattern will have no effect. The DEC knob controls the filter envelope decay time.</p> <p>Compressor</p> <p>The compressor is applied last of all RP-8's effects. There is only one control, the CT knob, which controls the compressor threshold. By default, the knob is all the way up, which means that the compressor will rarely have any effect. Reducing the compressor threshold should help make your song sound more even in volume, and should help your drum sounds and synth sounds fit together better. There's just one knob - try adjusting it and see if you like the results!</p> <p>Technical details: this compressor uses linear scaling (not logarithmic) with a hard knee, a fixed ratio of 4, and fixed attack and release times of approximately 2.5ms and 60ms, respectively.</p>"},{"location":"reference/#keyboard-controls","title":"Keyboard Controls","text":"<p>You can press <code>h</code> at any time to get a list of these shortcuts in RP-8.

Set your loop back to its original length again and listen to your new control automation!</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#automate-the-sound","title":"Automate the Sound","text":"<p>This section demonstrates the second recording method: realtime recording.</p> <p>The technique above is easy, but only lets you make changes in full-bar chunks. If you want a nice filter sweep, you'll have to use realtime recording instead. When you turn on record mode, by clicking the record button or pressing <code>r</code>, the record button will light up bright red, and RP-8 will begin immediately recording all control changes you make to the song.</p> <p>If looping is enabled, RP-8 will forget about all changed controls each time playback loops. This allows you to record automation for multiple controls in the same recording session, and means that you don't have to quickly hit stop to avoid recording over the start of your loop.</p> <p>When you pause playback, RP-8 will automatically exit record mode. You can also exit record mode by clicking the record button.</p> <p>TASK: Press <code>p</code> to quicksave your song in case something goes wrong or you record something you don't mean to.</p> <p>TASK: Go to the beginning of your loop, enable recording, and hit play. Move the synth filter cutoff knobs. Each time the song loops is a new take, so keep trying as long as you like!</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#sequence-your-patterns","title":"Sequence Your Patterns","text":"<p>This section demonstrates the third recording method: step recording.</p> <p>We're now going to record some pattern changes in your loop. You could do this using either of the previous two methods, but for pattern recording you often want to set patterns across many bars quickly. This is easy to do with step recording. When record mode is active, any changed controls are written to any bar you visit, even when paused. This means that you can enable recording, make some changes, and step forward or backward in the song to write those changes to each new bar.</p> <p>TASK: Press <code>p</code> to quicksave.</p> <p>TASK: Sequence all the pattern changes you want in your loop! Go to the first bar of your loop and enter record mode. Then select the patterns you want to play on that bar. Then use the the <code>.</code> key to move one bar forward and select the patterns you want to play on that bar. If you want to keep the same patterns for multiple bars, you can just skip through them, you do not need to click the pattern buttons again. If you make a mistake, you can backtrack with the <code>,</code> key to fix it, or if you make a big mistake, press <code>o</code> to quickload your last checkpoint.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You can also use the mouse to drag the song position control to navigate while recording is active, but, if you try this, use extreme care. Every control modified in the current recording session will be written to every bar you visit! You can easily overwrite many bars worth of sequencer data if you're not careful.</p> <p>Nice work! You now have a fully-sequenced loop. Let's finish this all off by copying your loop and making a variation.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/#duplicate-your-loop","title":"Duplicate Your Loop","text":"<p>To make major changes to the arrangement, we need to use the song editing tools near the top of the screen.

Now we just need to use the .WAV export feature to render your song to audio. There are two steps: first, prep your song for export by creating a few silent bars at the end. Then just enable export and play your song from the start.</p> <p>TASK: Add some silent bars at the end of your song. Move the loop past the end of the song and use change+commit recording to disable all three instruments for this section (click the red circle on the left side of the instrument to toggle whether it is enabled). Leave this loop enabled at the end of the song - you want to \"trap\" the playback position here after export so you don't get unexpected sounds at the end of your recording.</p> <p>TASK: Go back to the beginning of your song, and, while paused, press <code>e</code> to enable export. Then play your song to the end, and press <code>e</code> when done.
